<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Adhesives and Sealants Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Self-etching Adhesive</li><li>Selective-etching Adhesive</li><li>Total-etching Adhesive</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The adhesives and sealants market features three main types of dental adhesives: self-etching, selective-etching, and total-etching adhesives. Self-etching adhesives combine etching and priming in one step, simplifying application and reducing sensitivity. Selective-etching adhesives involve etching only the enamel, preserving dentin's natural layer for better bond strength. Total-etching adhesives require separate etching of both enamel and dentin, providing robust bonding but may increase the risk of sensitivity. Each type caters to specific dental needs and preferences, impacting application efficiency and bond durability.</p></p>
