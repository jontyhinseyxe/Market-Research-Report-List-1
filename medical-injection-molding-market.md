<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Medical Injection Molding Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cold Runner</li><li>Hot Runner</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Medical injection molding involves creating complex components for healthcare applications using two primary systems: cold runner and hot runner. Cold runner systems use a solidified channel for plastic flow, resulting in lower costs but increased material waste due to the need to remove and recycle leftover plastic. In contrast, hot runner systems maintain the plastic in a molten state, reducing waste and cycle times, which enhances production efficiency. Both types are integral to producing precise and sterile medical devices.</p></p>
