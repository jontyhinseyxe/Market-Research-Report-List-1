<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fishmeal Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Steam dried(SD)</li><li>Flame dried(FD)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The fishmeal market comprises two main types: steam-dried (SD) and flame-dried (FD) fishmeal. Steam-dried fishmeal involves cooking fish at high temperatures with steam, which helps retain nutrients and produces a finer product, often preferred in aquaculture. Flame-dried fishmeal, however, uses direct heat, resulting in a coarser texture and potentially higher levels of certain compounds, making it suitable for animal feed. Both methods cater to different industry needs and preferences, impacting their market demand and pricing.</p></p>
