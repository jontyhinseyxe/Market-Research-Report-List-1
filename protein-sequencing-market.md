<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Protein Sequencing Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Edman Degradation</li><li>Mass Spectrometry</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The protein sequencing market primarily comprises two key technologies: Edman degradation and mass spectrometry. Edman degradation is a classical technique that sequentially removes amino acids from the N-terminus of a protein, allowing for the determination of the amino acid sequence. In contrast, mass spectrometry offers a more modern approach, measuring the mass-to-charge ratio of ionized protein fragments to determine their sequence. Both methods serve crucial roles in proteomics, aiding in protein identification, characterization, and functional analysis.</p></p>
